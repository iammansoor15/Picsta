# Redux Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the React Native app from Context API to Redux Toolkit for state management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `@reduxjs/toolkit` - Modern Redux toolkit with simplified syntax
- `react-redux` - React bindings for Redux

### 2. Redux Store Structure
Created centralized store at `src/store/index.js` with three main slices:
- **Profile Slice** (`src/store/slices/profileSlice.js`) - Manages profile images
- **Profile Picture Slice** (`src/store/slices/profilePictureSlice.js`) - Manages profile picture state
- **Template Slice** (`src/store/slices/templateSlice.js`) - Manages template data

### 3. Context API Replacement
- **ProfileContext** → `profileSlice` with selectors and actions
- **ProfilePictureContext** → `profilePictureSlice` with selectors and actions  
- **TemplateContext** → `templateSlice` with selectors and actions

### 4. Component Updates
- **App.jsx**: Replaced Context providers with Redux Provider
- **HomeScreen.jsx**: Updated to use Redux hooks (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`)
- **ProfileScreen.jsx**: Updated to use Redux hooks and actions
- **ReduxInitializer.jsx**: New component to initialize Redux store with existing data

### 5. Key Features Preserved
- ✅ Profile image management
- ✅ Profile picture state management
- ✅ Template CRUD operations
- ✅ AsyncStorage persistence
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ All existing functionality

### 6. Benefits of Migration
- **Better Performance**: Redux only re-renders components when their specific state changes
- **Predictable State**: All state changes go through reducers
- **DevTools Support**: Better debugging with Redux DevTools
- **Scalability**: Easier to add new features and manage complex state
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support (when added)
- **Testing**: Easier to test state logic in isolation

### 7. File Structure
```
src/
├── store/
│   ├── index.js                 # Store configuration
│   └── slices/
│       ├── profileSlice.js      # Profile state management
│       ├── profilePictureSlice.js # Profile picture state
│       └── templateSlice.js     # Template state management
├── components/
│   └── ReduxInitializer.jsx     # Store initialization
└── screens/
    ├── HomeScreen.jsx           # Updated to use Redux
    └── ProfileScreen.jsx        # Updated to use Redux
```

### 8. Migration Notes
- All async operations (loading from storage, API calls) are handled via Redux thunks
- Selectors provide clean access to state data
- Actions maintain the same interface as the original Context methods
- Error handling and loading states are preserved
- No breaking changes to the user interface

## Testing
The migration has been tested and all functionality should work as before, but now with Redux state management instead of Context API.

## Next Steps
1. Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly
2. Consider adding Redux DevTools for better debugging
3. Add TypeScript types for better type safety
4. Consider adding middleware for logging or analytics
