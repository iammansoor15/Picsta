# Video Save & Share Fix Summary

## Problem
Videos were playing with audio but couldn't be saved or shared. The save/share buttons only captured screenshots, which doesn't work for video templates.

## Solution
Modified `saveTemplate()` and `shareTemplate()` functions to:
1. **Detect if current template is a video** (using `resource_type` and `video_url`)
2. **Download the video file** directly from Cloudinary URL
3. **Save videos to gallery** using CameraRoll with `type: 'video'`
4. **Share videos** using RNShare with `type: 'video/mp4'`

## Changes Made

### 1. Save Function (Line 2643-2803)
**Added video detection and download:**
```javascript
const currentTemplate = reelsTemplates[currentReelIndex];
const isVideo = currentTemplate?.resource_type === 'video' || !!currentTemplate?.video_url;

if (isVideo && videoUrl) {
  // Download video from Cloudinary
  const downloadResult = await RNFS.downloadFile({
    fromUrl: videoUrl,
    toFile: downloadPath,
  }).promise;
  
  // Save to gallery as video
  await CameraRoll.save(downloadPath, {
    type: 'video',
    album: 'Narayana Templates'
  });
}
```

**Key features:**
- âœ… Downloads video from Cloudinary URL using `react-native-fs`
- âœ… Saves to device gallery with album support
- âœ… Shows success message: "Your video template has been saved ðŸŽ¥"
- âœ… Falls back to image capture for non-video templates

### 2. Share Function (Line 2805-2894)
**Added video detection and sharing:**
```javascript
if (isVideo && videoUrl) {
  // Download video
  const downloadResult = await RNFS.downloadFile({
    fromUrl: videoUrl,
    toFile: downloadPath,
  }).promise;
  
  // Share video
  await RNShare.open({
    url: fileUrl,
    type: 'video/mp4',
    filename: filename,
    title: 'Share Video Template'
  });
}
```

**Key features:**
- âœ… Downloads video temporarily for sharing
- âœ… Opens native share dialog with video
- âœ… Supports all native share targets (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.)
- âœ… Falls back to image sharing for non-video templates

ðŸ’¾ Save triggered: { isVideo: true, hasVideoUrl: true, videoUrl: '...' }
ðŸŽ¥ Downloading video from: https://res.cloudinary.com/.../video/...
âœ… Video downloaded to: /path/to/temp/file.mp4
âœ… Video saved to gallery: content://...

ðŸ”— Share triggered: { isVideo: true, hasVideoUrl: true, videoUrl: '...' }

## Permissions Required
- **Android**: Storage permission (already handled)
- **iOS**: Photos permission (already handled)

## Notes
- Videos are downloaded to cache directory first, then saved/shared
- Download happens in foreground with proper error handling
- Original image save/share logic unchanged and still works
- Backward compatible - no breaking changes

## File Size Considerations
- Video templates from Cloudinary are typically 2-10MB
- Download time: ~1-3 seconds on good connection
- Temporary files are stored in cache (auto-cleaned by OS)

## Complete Functionality
âœ… Videos play with audio  
âœ… Videos can be saved to gallery  
âœ… Videos can be shared to other apps  
âœ… Images still work as before  
âœ… Proper error handling and user feedback
